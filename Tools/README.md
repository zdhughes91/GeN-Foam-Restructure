This folder contains helper tools that have been developed throughout the years by GeN-Foam users to simplify the use of GeN-Foam. They are not necessary tools for GeN-Foam, just tools that can potentially simplify some pre- and post-processing operations. They are not supposed to be general-purpose tools, and they have not been designed with user-friendliness in mind. However, we believe they can eb of help to some users.
