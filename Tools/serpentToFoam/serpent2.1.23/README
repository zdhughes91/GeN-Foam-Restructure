This is an octave script that has been created to automatically convert Serpent output files into GeN-Foam-readable nuclearData and perturbed nuclearData* files. One should be able to run the script by typing autoOctaveSerpentToFoamXS on an octave shell. Input parameters are specified in the universesToInclude.m file.
