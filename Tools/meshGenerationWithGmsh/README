This folder contains three examples of mesh generation for a SFR core using gmsh.
To obtain each mesh one should:
- enter the folder
- type "gmsh esfr.main" in the terminal
- wait (a long time)
- mesh the geometry once the window is unfrozed
- save the .msh file that can then be converted to OpenFOAM using gmshToFoam

Different core geometries can be obtained by changing parameters in coreGeometry.geo. 

These are just supposed to be examples, not general-purpose tools for geometry creation. Comments are limited.
