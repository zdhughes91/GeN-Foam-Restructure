2D_MSFR_ULOF_diffusion_and_pk is a 2-D r-z model of a Molten Salt Fast Reactor. It solves for
neutronics and thermal-hydraulics.

The case is the same as 2D_MSFR, excpet that:
- a coupled fluid and energy simulation is run to ensure a better coupling
  betwee energy and velocity
- a loss-of-flow transient is run by using both diffusion and point kinetics

The tutorial has been prepared by Arnaldo Mattioli (Politecnico di Milano) and 
revised by C. Fiorina (EPFL).
