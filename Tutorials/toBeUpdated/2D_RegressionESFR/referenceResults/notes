Notes on the Post-processed Results

While the majority of the results should be intuitive to understand in the way
they are presented, there are only a few remarks to be made.

-	the reported "rhok" is actually rho*rhok (recall that buoyancy is treated via
	a Boussinesq approximation)
-   Disp[0] is the radial displacement of the reported structures
-	the pressure drop is NOT inclusive of the hydrostatic component (it's better
	to state the obvious) and it consists in the pressure drop across the active
	fuel region only (i.e. the innerCore and outerCore regions)
