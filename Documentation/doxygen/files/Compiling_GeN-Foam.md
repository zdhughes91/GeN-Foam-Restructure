# Compiling GeN-Foam {#COMPILE}

GeN-Foam is built as a standard OpenFOAM solver, based on the www.openfoam.com distribution. As such, one should first install the latest OpenFOAM version and then compile GeN-Foam by typing in a terminal

`./Allwclean`

`./Allwmake`

from the GeN-Foam source code folder. 

Please notice that a new version of OpenFOAM is released by ESI/OpenCFD twice a year. It may take a few weeks for the developers to update GeN-Foam to a new OpenFOAM release.
