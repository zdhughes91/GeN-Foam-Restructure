abstract = {The Laboratory for Reactor Physics and Systems Behaviour at the PSI and at the EPFL has been developing since 2013 a multi-physics platform for coupled reactor analysis named GeN-Foam. The developed tool includes a solver for the eigenvalue and transient solution of multi-group neutron diffusion equations. Although frequently used in reactor analysis, the diffusion theory shows some limitations for core configurations involving strong anisotropies, which is the case for the CROCUS research reactor at the EPFL. The use of an SP3 approximation to neutron transport can often lead to visible improvements in a code predictive capabilities, especially for one-directional anisotropies, with acceptable added computational cost vs diffusion. Following some modelling issues for the CROCUS reactor, and in order to improve the GeN-Foam modelling capabilities, the GeN-Foam diffusion solver has been extended to allow for SP3 analyses. The present paper describes such extension and a preliminary verification using a mini-core PWR benchmark. The newly developed solver is then applied to the analysis of the CROCUS experimental reactor and results are compared to Monte Carlo calculations, as well as to the results of the diffusion solver.}

abstract = {Recent numerical advancements at the Laboratory for Reactor Physics and Systems Behaviour (LRS) have led to the development of a novel two-phase porous medium-based thermal–hydraulic simulation tool, integrated in the broader multi-physics framework of the GeN-Foam code. This simulation tool takes advantage of the modern programming paradigm offered by the finite volume-oriented OpenFOAM numerical library. It enables the 3-D investigation of thermal-hydraulic phenomena in nuclear systems via a dispersed Euler-Euler 6-equation formalism for the representation of two-phase flow. Stemming from previous work related to the presentation and verification of the solution algorithms, this paper is focused on the presentation of the modelling capabilities and their validation against different sets of sodium boiling experiments. These experiments were performed under both quasi-steady-state and transient conditions at former experimental facilities at the Joint Research Centre, Ispra and Kernforschungszentrum Karlsruhe.}

abstract = {The Laboratory for Reactor Physics and Systems Behaviour at the PSI and the EPFL has been developing in recent years a new code system for reactor analysis based on OpenFOAM®. The objective is to supplement available legacy codes with a modern tool featuring state-of-the-art characteristics in terms of scalability, programming approach and flexibility. As part of this project, a new solver has been developed for the eigenvalue and transient solution of multi-group diffusion equations. Several features distinguish the developed solver from other available codes, in particular: object oriented programming to ease code modification and maintenance; modern parallel computing capabilities; use of general unstructured meshes; possibility of mesh deformation; cell-wise parametrization of cross-sections; and arbitrary energy group structure. In addition, the solver is integrated into the GeN-Foam multi-physics solver. The general features of the solver and its integration with GeN-Foam have already been presented in previous publications. The present paper describes the diffusion solver in more details and provides an overview of new features recently implemented, including the use of acceleration techniques and discontinuity factors. In addition, a code verification is performed through a comparison with Monte Carlo results for both a thermal and a fast reactor system.}

abstract = {A porous medium-based representation of nuclear reactors and complex engineering systems more in general can significantly reduce simulation and modelling costs, while preserving a reasonable degree of accuracy via regime map-based correlations for modelling physical interactions. This paper presents a segregated algorithm for the simulation of dispersed two phase flows in such systems treated as porous media in an Eulerian framework. The global algorithm pertaining to the coupling between the mass, momentum and energy conservation equations solution is discussed and implemented via the finite volume OpenFOAM programming library. In the context of pressure–velocity coupling, a novel implementation of the Partial Elimination Algorithm for the treatment of the inter-phase momentum transfer term is developed. It is found to perform better than existing implementations for a number of cases with important momentum coupling between phases. A conclusive verification of the overall solution algorithm is performed with the Method of Manufactured Solutions and order-of-accuracy testing. From an implementation perspective, the performance of the algorithm in parallel strong scaling up to 4096 cores is assessed and proves to be in line with OpenFOAM-based code standards.}

abstract = {The FAST group at the Paul Scherrer Institut has been developing a code system for reactor analysis for many years. For transient analysis, this code system is currently based on a state-of-the-art coupled TRACE-PARCS routine. This work presents an attempt to supplement the FAST code system with a novel solver characterized by tight coupling between the different equations, parallel computing capabilities, adaptive time-stepping and more accurate treatment of some of the phenomena involved in a reactor transient. The new solver is based on OpenFOAM®, an open-source C++ library for the solution of partial differential equations using finite-volume discretization. It couples together a multi-scale fine/coarse mesh sub-solver for thermal-hydraulics, a multi-group diffusion sub-solver for neutronics, a displacement-based sub-solver for thermal-mechanics and a finite-difference model for the temperature field in the fuel. It is targeted toward the analysis of pin-based reactors (e.g., liquid metal fast reactors or light water reactors) or homogeneous reactors (e.g., fast-spectrum molten salt reactors). This paper presents each “single-physics” sub-solver and the overall coupling strategy, using the sodium-cooled fast reactor as a test case, and essential code verification tests are described.}

The code can be used both for studying complex 2D or 3D local effects and for more traditional 1.5D base irradiation analyses. OFFBEAT is based on the open-source C++ library OpenFOAM®, thus the governing equations are discretized with modern finite volume techniques using unstructured meshes, and the solver is fully parallelized via geometrical domain decomposition. This paper presents the numerical framework, governing equations and solution strategy behind OFFBEAT and it gives a brief overview of the material properties and behavioral models already implemented. Finally, a set of experimental rods is chosen to provide the first validation results for the thermal behavior of low burnup axisymmetric rods, by comparing the fuel centerline temperatures with experimental data.}
