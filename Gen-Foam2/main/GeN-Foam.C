Description
    Multi-physics solver for nuclear reactor analysis. It couples a multi-scale
    fine/coarse mesh 3-phase (liquid, vapour, porous substructure) sub-solver 
    for thermal-hydraulics, various sub-solvers for neutronics,
    a displacement-based sub-solver for thermal-mechanics. The 
    thermal-hydraulic sub-solver consists of the custom developed FFSEulerFoam 
    solver  (https://gitlab.com/virmodoetiae/FFSEulerFoam). It is capable of
    modelling single and two-phase flows, while modelled fuel types consist
    of either liquid fuel (e.g. MSRs) or fuel pin lattices. For the latter,
    the energy dynamics is represented via a 1.5-D finite difference model.
