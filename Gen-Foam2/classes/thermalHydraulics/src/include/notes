Why do I need a diameter model? 
    To be able to compute the Reynolds number(s) and HTCs

How do I compute the Reynolds?
    I can define multiple Reynolds numbers as:
        -   fluid-intensive for fluid i Re_i = alphai*Ui*Di/nui
            with :
            --  Di = Dh_struct if fluid is continuous;
            --  Di = D from a diameterModel if the fluid is dispersed;
        -   fluid-pair Re_p = |U1-U2|*D_disp/nu_cont
    Pleased note that the different Us in the above equations refer to
    the real (i.e. not superficial) phase velocity

How to I compute the HTC?
    It depends on the actual model. However, if a Nusselt-based
    correlation is used, then:
        -   for a fluid-structure HTC_i = Nu_i*ki/Di with:
            --  Nui = func(Re_i) with the fluid-intensive Reynolds;
            --  Di = Dh_thermoStruct if the fluid is continuous;
            --  Di = D from a diameterModel if the fluid is dispersed;
        -   for the fluid-fluid HTC_p = Nu_p*k_cont/D_disp with:
            -- Nu_p = func(Re_p) with the fluid-pair Reynolds

Observations:
    -   I need a way to know which phase is dispersed and which phase 
        is continuous.
    -   Since there is only one dispersed phase per regime, I only need
        one diameter model (for now named dispersedPhaseDiameterModel).
    -   In principle, the interfacialArea between the two fluids and 
        the hydraulic diameter of the dispersed phases are 
        inter-dependent. Nonetheless, I still want to give the user 3
        options:
        --  specify both an interfacialAreaModel and a dispersedPhase
            DiameterModel (that are not necesarily compatible);
        --  specify an interfacialAreaModel and a "fromInterfacialArea"
            model for the diameter, which computes the dipsersed phase
            diameter given the current interfacialArea and a topology
            for the dispersed phase;
        --  specify a dispersedPhaseDiameterModel and a "fromDiameter"
            model for the interfacialArea, which computes the 
            interfacialArea given the current disperspedPhaseDiameter
            and a topology for the dispersed phase.
        It is very easy to show the connection between interfacialArea
        and dispersed phase diameter for the following dispersed phase
        topologies:
        --  N bubbles   -> iA=6*alpha_disp/D_bubble (independent of N);
        --  Cylinder    -> iA=4*alpha_disp/D_cylinder;
        of course these are simplistic topologies, yet these options of
        connecting the bubble diameter to the interfacialArea (or vice-
        versa) might prove quite valuable for the future. Nonetheless,
        I still need to derive more relations for more topologies.
